            <li><strong>1934 </strong>- Mangeshkar took her first lessons from her father. At the age of five, she started to work as an actress in her father's musical plays (Sangeet Natak in Marathi).On the first day in the school, she started teaching songs to other children. When the teacher stopped her, she was so angry that she stopped going to the school.</li>
            <li><strong>1942 </strong>- When Mangeshkar was 13, her father died of heart disease. Master Vinayak (Vinayak Damodar Karnataki), the owner of Navyug Chitrapat movie company and a close friend of the Mangeshkar family, took care of them. He helped Lata get started in a career as a singer and actress. </li>
            <li><strong>1943 </strong>-  Her first Hindi song was <i>"Mata Ek Sapoot Ki Duniya Badal De Tu"</i> for the Marathi film, <i>Gajaabhaau</i> .</li>
            <li><strong>1945 </strong>- Lata moved to Mumbai.She started taking lessons in Hindustani classical music from Ustad Amanat Ali Khan. Mangeshkar and her sister Asha played minor roles in Vinayak's first Hindi-language movie, Badi Maa</li>
            <li><strong>1946 </strong>- She sang <i>“Paa Lagoon Kar Jori”</i> for Vasant Joglekar's Hindi-language movie Aap Ki Seva Mein. Lata also sang a bhajan,<i>"Maata Tere Charnon Mein"</i>.

            <li><strong>1947 </strong>- Following the partition of India in 1947, Ustad Amanat Ali Khan migrated to newly formed Pakistan, so Mangeshkar started to learn classical music under Amanat Khan Devaswale, the nephew of Rajab Ali Khan.

            <li><strong>1948 </strong>- After Vinayak's death in 1948, music director Ghulam Haider mentored her as a singer. He introduced Mangeshkar to producer Sashadhar Mukherjee, who was working then on the movie Shaheed, but Mukherjee dismissed Mangeshkar's voice as "too thin".An annoyed Haider responded that in coming years producers and directors would "fall at Lata's feet" and "beg her" to sing in their movies. Haider gave Lata her first major break with the song <i>"Dil Mera Toda, Mujhe Kahin Ka Na Chhora"</i>—lyrics by Nazim Panipati—from the movie Majboor, which became her first big breakthrough film hit.</li>
